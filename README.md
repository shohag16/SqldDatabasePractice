# SQLDatabasePractice
## Overview

A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a way that allows for efficient access, retrieval, and manipulation. It can be used to store various types of information, such as text, numbers, images, or any other data, which can be organized into tables, rows, and columns in a structured manner.

# Key Characteristics of a Database:
**Organized Structure:** Data is stored systematically, making it easy to retrieve and manage.

**Data Relationships:** Databases can define relationships between data points (e.g., between customers and their orders).

**Efficient Data Access:** Databases are designed for quick and efficient data access using specialized query languages.

**Data Integrity:** Ensures that the data remains accurate and consistent.

**Multi-user Access:** Many databases allow multiple users to access and modify data simultaneously.

# Types of Databases:

**Relational Databases (RDBMS):**

- Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
- Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for operations.
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
  
**NoSQL Databases:**

- Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Often used in big data and real-time web applications.
- Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra.

**Object-oriented Databases:**

- Data is stored as objects, similar to object-oriented programming.
Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.

**Distributed Databases:**

- Data is spread across multiple locations or servers.
Examples: Apache Cassandra, Google Bigtable.

**Cloud Databases:**

- Hosted in the cloud, offering scalability and accessibility.
Examples: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Spanner.

**Hierarchical and Network Databases:**

- Data is organized in a tree-like (hierarchical) or graph-like (network) structure.
Examples: IBM Information Management System (IMS).


**Common Uses of Databases:**

- E-commerce: Managing product catalogs and customer orders.
- Banking: Recording transactions and customer data.
- Healthcare: Storing patient records.
- Education: Keeping track of students, courses, and grades.
- Social Media: Managing user profiles, posts, and connections.

## What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to interact with relational databases. It is used for:
- Storing, retrieving, and manipulating data
- Managing database structures
- Ensuring data integrity and security

---

## SQL Basics

### Example: Creating a Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Example: Inserting Data
```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
```

### Example: Querying Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

---

## SQL Data Types
Common SQL data types include:
- **Numeric:** `INT`, `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`
- **Character:** `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`
- **Date/Time:** `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`
- **Others:** `BOOLEAN`, `BLOB`, `TEXT`

---

## SQL Commands

### DDL (Data Definition Language)
Used to define database schemas:
- `CREATE`
- `ALTER`
- `DROP`
- `TRUNCATE`

Example:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15);
```

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)
Used to manipulate data:
- `SELECT`
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`

Example:
```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'new.email@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
```

### DCL (Data Control Language)
Used to control access:
- `GRANT`
- `REVOKE`

Example:
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON users TO 'username';
```

### TCL (Transaction Control Language)
Used to manage transactions:
- `COMMIT`
- `ROLLBACK`
- `SAVEPOINT`

Example:
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;
ROLLBACK;
```

---

## Common SQL Clauses

- **WHERE**: Filters rows based on conditions.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
  ```
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts results.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
  ```
- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows for aggregation.
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*), created_at FROM users GROUP BY created_at;
  ```
- **HAVING**: Filters groups after aggregation.
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY created_at HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```

---

## Joins in SQL
Joins are used to combine rows from multiple tables.

- **INNER JOIN:** Returns matching rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT users.name, orders.id
  FROM users
  INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
  ```

- **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
  ```sql
  SELECT users.name, orders.id
  FROM users
  LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
  ```

- **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
  ```sql
  SELECT users.name, orders.id
  FROM users
  RIGHT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
  ```

- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
  ```sql
  SELECT users.name, orders.id
  FROM users
  FULL OUTER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
  ```

---

## SQL Functions

### Aggregate Functions
- `COUNT()`: Counts rows
- `SUM()`: Calculates sum
- `AVG()`: Calculates average
- `MIN()`: Finds minimum value
- `MAX()`: Finds maximum value

Example:
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
```

### String Functions
- `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `CONCAT()`, `SUBSTRING()`

Example:
```sql
SELECT UPPER(name) FROM users;
```

### Date Functions
- `NOW()`, `CURDATE()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `DATE_ADD()`

Example:
```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF(NOW(), created_at) FROM users;
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Proper Indexing**: Add indexes to columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY` clauses.
2. **Avoid SELECT ***: Always specify required columns.
3. **Use Transactions**: Ensure data consistency with transactions.
4. **Normalize Your Database**: Follow normalization principles to reduce redundancy.
5. **Backup Regularly**: Always keep backups of your database.
